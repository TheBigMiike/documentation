# What is the MediaTracker ? #

The ***mediatracker*** looks like a **movie maker** software where you can edit your TrackMania / ShootMania replays : You can add effects, manipulate the camera like you want, add text or images, etc...

## In which case I can use the MediaTracker ? ##

### To create videos ###

MediaTracker is mostly used to create movies : Players saves replays and they edit them using the MediaTracker.

Many videos about ManiaPlanet games you can see on YouTube are made with the MediaTracker. See somes examples here : http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVdgBqdi7grni-5a8sWDLvfVMUft21iO1

### During a game###

You can also use the MediaTracker to control on somes maps **what you want to display to the player on his screen**. You can...
* Create introductions
* Create outroductions
* Create ambiances (Add fog,...)
* Control what you want to display during the game

# Edit a replay to do my first movie / screenshoot #

## 1st step : Save and open a replay on the MediaTracker ##

2 possibilities to save a replay:
* **Replays are autosaved** so you don't need to save your replays yourself. Go to "Editor" > "Edit a replay", go on the "AutoSaves" folder and select your replay. Double click on "Launch" (at the bottom). A menu appears, click on "Advanced Editor".
* **You need to save your replays yourself** by pressing the "Esc" button on your keyboard. On the menu, click on "Advanced settings" and then "Save replay" or "Save previous replay".

## 2nd step : Edit the replay ##

Once the replay is opened on the MediaTracker, you should see an interface like this one :

### Objective n° 1: Manipulate the camera ###

Click on the "Free camera" button (Button n° 23 on the previous picture) to manipulate the camera.

* **In order to move the camera forwards**, backwards or point it to the right or left, use the direction arrows. 
* **In order to raise or lower the camera**, use the 'Previous page' and 'Next page' keys or the scroll button of the mouse. 
* **In order to rotate the camera**, move your mouse by keeping the right button down. By using the + and – keyboard keys, you are able to increase and reduce your speed of movement.

### Objective n° 2: Add and modify a custom camera ###
Click on the track tool (1) so as to display the following menu:

![](http://wiki.maniaplanet.com/pool/images/f/fd/En_basicactions.png)

Then select the 'camera custom' track which will be added to the timeline. Click on the first key of the custom camera block.

Then move into the space by using the keyboard arrows. Try to find the car corresponding to the replay in the map. Then click on the overview tool in order to see the movement that you have thus created. You should see the camera move as it moves away from the car. So as to modify the endpoint of your movement, and thus change the camera’s trajectory, click on the last key of the block and then follow the same procedure.

There is nothing magical or hard-to-understand about it, so don't let the dark GUI and the small buttons intimidate you :-)
